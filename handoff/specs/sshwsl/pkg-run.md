# Package RUN: the command runners (local POSIX and Windows), launchers, environment, job host, kill ladder

Read first: `specs/pkg-common.md`, `specs/sshwsl/pkg-common.md`, `specs/sshwsl/decisions.md` (OWNER DECISION 4), then
`specs/sshwsl/design.md`: header, "Limitations and departures" (L2, L3, L9, L10, L14), §3.1, §3.3 (normative argv,
spawn options, job host, environment), §3.6 (real paths: `inspect`), §3.7 (`GitFacts`), §3.10, §3.11 (the secret
tracker you feed), §3.13 (the ladder per kind), §10.1-§10.2 (RUN rows), §11.4 (RUN row), "Critique resolutions" rows
naming RUN (security-12, wsl-16, wsl-17, integration-8, -9, -10, -18, -23, -27, -31).

## Goal
Run one command on this computer exactly as decided, in a PTY where `script(1)` exists (Linux, macOS) or on pipes
(Windows, POSIX without `script`), with the command text never on any argv, the environment cleaned, every Windows run
in a kill-on-close job from birth, and Stop/the kill switch/timeouts reaching the whole tree. Also export the launcher
and ladder pieces WA (WSL) and SB (the remote agent) reuse. Plain Node; koffi lazily, Windows only.

## Start and merge
Starts when S0a has merged. Merges after CL.

## Files you own
- `app/main/commands/run/local.ts` (S0a stub), `shells.ts` (landed by S0a: keep its texts byte-identical unless a
  CI run proves one wrong; then change it and say so), `env.ts`, `kill.ts`, `sweep.ts`, `job-host.ts` (S0a stub; built to
  `dist/app/job-host.cjs`), `win32-job.ts` (lazy koffi bindings: `CreateJobObjectW`, `SetInformationJobObject`,
  `AssignProcessToJobObject`, `GetCurrentProcess`, `TerminateJobObject`), `inspect.ts`, `git-facts.ts`, `facts.ts`.
- `test/unit/commands-run-{argv,env,kill,sweep,facts,job-host}.test.ts`, `test/integration/commands-local.test.ts`.

## Shared files you may touch
- `.github/workflows/remote.yml`: the `commands-linux` job's set-up steps only (S0a wrote the job).

## Contracts you implement (normative)

## What to build
- `start(spec)` per §3.3's table and spawn options: POSIX PTY (util-linux `script -q -e -f -c … /dev/null`, stdin a pipe
  **kept open until the run ends**; BSD `script -q /dev/null /bin/sh -c …`), POSIX pipes (stdin ignored), Windows
  PowerShell through the job host (`{ detached: false, windowsHide: true }`). `EMBER_CMD` and `EMBER_RUN_ID` in the
  environment, never on argv. The start marker (`\x1b]777;ember-start\x07`) seen → started; output ending without it →
  `failed-to-start` with stderr.
- `RunningCommand`: raw output bytes to subscribers (kept up to 4 MiB: head 64 KiB + rolling tail); `input()` only for
  interactive runs (never logged); `typedLines()`/`forgetTyped()`; the secret tracker fed with decoded output and Enter
  presses; `stop(why)` runs the ladder.
- The ladder (§3.13): POSIX `\x03`/SIGINT at once, SIGTERM to group + `pkill -s` session + sweep at 300 ms, SIGKILL at
  1000 ms, last sweep at 1500 ms with stragglers named; Windows: terminate the job host at t = 0. The kill switch path
  is synchronous for step 1.
- The job host (§3.3): assigns itself to a kill-on-close job **before** spawning; relays stdin when interactive;
  `TerminateJobObject` when its stdin ends; exit 125 with `job` on stderr if the job can't be made.
- `commandEnv` (§3.3.1): removals (Ember's, Electron's, Node's, Copilot's and the sign-in tokens, rc-injection and
  loader variables, SSH's on remotes), `appEnv`'s repairs, `extraPath` appended, non-interactive defaults on pipe runs
  only, case-insensitive names on Windows.
- `inspect(paths, cwd)`: `fs.lstat` + `fs.realpathSync.native` (nearest existing parent + rest when missing); never
  throws. `gitFacts(cwd)`: fixed argv `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, `git config --get push.default`,
  `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u}` with `cwd`, 5 s, read-only, null outside a work tree.
- `facts()`: shells found (Windows: `["powershell"]` only), `shellPaths` (POSIX paths made only of `[A-Za-z0-9/._-]`),
  `script` (util-linux by `script --version`, or BSD on macOS), `privileged` from `o.elevated()` (no `whoami` parsing),
  `ember` with live pids, `extraPath`.
- `MAX_RUNS_PER_TARGET = 3` is the service's (TG/AG), not yours; `running` is your count.

## Tests
- Unit (OS-neutral, fake spawn/fs/koffi/timers): exact argv and spawn options per OS/shell/PTY; the command text never in
  argv; `commandEnv` rules; the ladder's timing per kind; sweep parsing (`/proc` and `ps -E` fixtures); `pkill -s` step;
  the job host's call order (job, assign self, spawn; terminate on stdin end) with a fake koffi; elevation from the
  injected function.
- Integration `test/integration/commands-local.test.ts` (`EMBER_COMMANDS_TEST=1`; job `commands-linux`, and on win32 /
  darwin in `wsl-windows` and `ssh-macos`): §10.2's list (PTY `tty`, Ctrl+C, `sleep 1000 & wait`, `setsid sleep`, exit
  codes, `read -s -p Password:` withheld and typed line removed, `git log` without a pager, timeouts, no `script` →
  pipes; Windows: PowerShell UTF-8, exit codes incl. a non-terminating cmdlet error, CLM, the job host kills a
  `Start-Process` child at once, no console window, elevation; macOS: zsh, BSD `script` exit status, `ps -E` sweep,
  Homebrew on PATH).

## Acceptance criteria
- `createLocalRunner` and the exports above with exactly these signatures; WA and SB can import them unchanged.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` pass; integration green in CI or reported "not run".
- No koffi import at module top level; nothing under your files imports `electron`.
